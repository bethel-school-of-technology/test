Smokers is the highest correlation with charges# 2. Age and bmi are not really correlated but they are higher than the others apart from smokers# 3. There is no issue of multicollinearity between our independent variables# Moving forward I will not be using Smokers and Region variables in my statistica modeling.# They do not meet the assumption of normality. We do know that smoking has a high correlation.# I want to see if the other factors have a significant impact on the years expected charges.#Export updated dataset for statistical modelinginsurance.to_csv(r'/Users/michaelwilt/Desktop/Medical Cost Project/datasets/insuranceForStats.csv', index=False)
